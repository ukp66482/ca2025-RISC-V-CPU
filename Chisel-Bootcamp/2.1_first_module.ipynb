The following explains how to think of each line in terms of the hardware we are describing.\n\n```scala\nclass Passthrough extends Module {\n```\nWe declare a new module called `Passthrough`. `Module` is a built-in Chisel class that all hardware modules must extend.\n\n```scala \nval io = IO(...)\n```\nWe declare all our input and output ports in a special `io` `val`. It must be called `io` and be an `IO` object or instance, which requires something of the form `IO(_instantiated_bundle_)`.\n\n```scala\nnew Bundle {\n    val in = Input(...)\n    val out = Output(...)\n}\n```\nWe declare a new hardware struct type (Bundle) that contains some named signals `in` and `out` with directions Input and Output, respectively.\n\n```scala\nUInt(4.W)\n```\nWe declare a signal's hardware type. In this case, it is an unsigned integer of width 4.\n\n```scala\nio.out := io.in\n```\nWe connect our input port to our output port, such that `io.in` *drives* `io.out`. Note that the `:=` operator is a ***Chisel*** operator that indicates that the right-hand signal drives the left-hand signal. It is a directioned operator.\n\nThe neat thing about hardware construction languages (HCLs) is that we can use the underlying programming language as a scripting language. For example, after declaring our Chisel module, we then use Scala to call the Chisel compiler to translate Chisel `Passthrough` into Verilog `Passthrough`.
