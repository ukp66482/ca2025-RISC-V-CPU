Most classes use a code block to define variables, constants, and methods (functions).\n* `val max: Long =` -- the class contains a member variable **max**, declared as type `Long` and initialized as the class is created.\n* `(1 << counterBits) - 1` computes the maximum value that can be contained in **counterBits** bits.  Since **max** was created with `val` it cannot be changed.\n* A variable **counter** is created and initialized to **0L**. The **L** says that 0 is a long value; thus, **counter** is inferred to be Long.\n* **max** and **counter** are commonly called _member variables_ of the class.\n* A class method **inc** is defined which takes no arguments and returns a **Long** value.\n* The body of the method **inc** is a code block that has:\n  * `counter = counter + 1` increments **counter**.\n  * `if (counter > max) { counter = 0 }` tests if the counter is greater than the **max** value and sets it back to zero if it is.\n  * `counter` -- The last line of the code block is important.\n    * Any value expressed as the last line of a code block is considered to be the return value of that code block. The return value can be used or ignored by the calling statement.\n    * This applies quite generally; for example, since an `if` then `else` statement defines its true and false clauses with code blocks, it can return a value i.e., `val result = if (10 * 10 > 90) \"greater\" else \"lesser\"` would create a `val` with the value \"greater\".\n  * So in this case the function **inc** returns the value of **counter**.\n* `println(s\"counter created with max value $max\")` prints a string to standard output.  Because the **println** is directly in the defining code block, it is part of the class initialization code and is run, i.e. prints out the string, every time an instance of this class is created.\n* The string printed in this case is an _interpolated_ string.\n  * The leading **s** in front of the first double quote identifies this as an interpolated string.\n  * An interpolated string is processed at run time.  \n  * The **\\$max** is replaced with the value of max.\n  * If the **\\$** is followed by a code block, arbitrary Scala can be in that code block.\n    * For example, **`println(s\"doubled max is ${max + max}\")`**.\n    * The return value of this code block will be inserted  in place of `${...}`.\n    * If the return value is not a string, it will be converted to one; virtually every class or type in scala has an implicit conversion to a string defined).\n  * You should generally avoid printing something every time an instance of a class is created to avoid flooding standard output, unless you're debugging.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n# Creating an Instance of a Class\nLet's use our example above to create a class.

Parameters to class definitions also use this named argument scheme (they are actually just the parameters to the constructor method for the class).\n\nWhen certain parameters have default values (that don't need to be overridden), callers only have to pass (by name) specific arguments that do not use defaults.
